Hello World

beginning of the code

----
verb = raw_input("Please input the verb : ")

verb[len(verb)] = 'ÙŽ'
print verb+verb[len(verb)]

----
end of the code


I wanted to try ^ but I got this error : 

  File "font_1.00000.py", line 4
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xd9' in file font_1.00000.py on line 4, 
but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details

Also, I am not so exactly sure how to use github, how am I supposed to geth the code up here?!
